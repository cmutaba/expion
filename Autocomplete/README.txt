Below is a very simple autocomplete solution using Angular. I kept it very simple. (I can work on the optional part and styling later given the one-hour time constraint).

To run the code, please place the app.js and index.html files in the same directory. Then click on the index.html page to open it on a browser. Start typing random words to get the autocomplete feature to work. I downloaded 50 random words for this demo.
